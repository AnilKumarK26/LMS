                        Welcome to <strong className="cpp-highlight" id="cpp-highlight">C++ Basics</strong>: A Practical Introduction to C++. This
                        course is designed to help developers of all levels explore C++, a
                        high-performance programming language known for its versatility and
                        speed.<br /><br />
                        Whether you're an experienced programmer or just starting out, C++ 
                        will empower you to create everything from small applications to
                        complex systems software.

                        C++ is a highly efficient, compiled programming language that enables
                        fine control over system resources and memory. It's widely used in
                        systems programming, game development, real-time applications, and
                        performance-critical applications like operating systems and
                        embedded systems.

                        With C++, you can write programs that require high performance while
                        also having the flexibility to operate at both high and low levels of
                        abstraction.

                            <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
                            <p>
                                C++ was one of the first widely adopted languages to support OOP. 
                                Concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation 
                                allow developers to build complex systems that are modular and maintainable.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                C++ gives you direct access to memory through pointers and manual memory management. 
                                This allows for optimized and precise control, making it a favorite for 
                                performance-critical applications.

                                C++ comes with the STL, a powerful library of algorithms, data structures, 
                                and iterators that makes programming more efficient and reusable.

                            <p>
                                C++ can be used to develop applications for a wide range of platforms, 
                                from Windows to Linux and embedded systems, making it versatile in various environments.
